    Welcome to Titania
  </title>
  <hi> Custom map, 20 times skill gain, 20 time action, heavily modded

If you are new to Wurm or Wurm Unlimited I strongly recommend taking full advantage of the wurmpedia which you will find here  http://www.wurmpedia.com/index.php/Main_Page

The spawn town of Camelot has a few things to offer new players.  Upstairs in the 2 main buildings are free beds so you can gain sleep bonus.

Be sure to talk to Horace the Stable Master for a free horse. There are also some free horses in the stables behind Horace.  

Bounty is enabled at 10 times the normal rate with the exception of pigs and dogs, which pay 1 silver each also chickens pay 50 copper each.  Open a bank account at the token so your bounty money has somewhere to go.  Take advantage of this to build your funds and your fighting skill.

If you choose to stay in the town for a while I suggest you build a large cart and enchant with 'Bag of Holding' to keep your belongs safe.  I also recommend making some small or large crates. Crates have been modded so small crates hold 300 and large crates hold 600.  You can park your cart on the East side of building 1

The dirt level on Titania is low, but surface mining has be modded to be easier, or if you prefer you can cast 'dirt' on a crate or BSB.  The dirt spell cost is 5 favor and will get you 300 dirt.

Features

Public mine
Take the South bound road to the turn off for the Public mine. The mine is fully equipped with forges, large anvils, amphora's fill with water and BSB's with logs to fuel the forges. The mine has 3 caves with all the vein types  you may need or want.  Use these to build your mining and prospecting skills and to make any items, tools, weapons or armour you think you might need.  PLEASE place anything you mine that you don't want to keep in the trash heaps provided.

Portals
There are 3 main portals on the West side of building 2 leading to White Light Island, Dragon Island and Goblin Leader Island.  Hovering over any portal will tell you where that portal will take you.  To use a portal, right click on it and select port.  When you have a deed I can make you a portals too and from Camelot.

White Light Island
Take the Portal to the White Light Altar and become a follower and a priest of the deity of your choice.  Pray to get faith and favor to at least 70, this won't take long.  All priests can do all spells and the maximum favour cost  is set at 20.

Uniques Hunting Islands

Dragon Island
Dragons are tough so I recommend making some adamant or glimmer steel armour and improving it to at least 75 quality.  Also your weapons should be around 75 quality.  You will need at least level 50 fighting skill.  It is also a good idea to go with at least one other player.  A dragon will agro on you up to 30 tiles away.  Once aggroed on you they will follow you to the ends of the map, even over water, so please DO NOT have them follow to the mainland as they will destroy buildings.  The portal back to Camelot is inside a mine on the island, however the dragon do go into the mine.  If you have dragons on your tail, there are tunnels in the mine you can run around in and possibly use ''strongwall'' to trap the dragon/s.  If you are fighting a dragon you will not be able to port as porting is second to the combat.  You will have to take off auto fight and target before you can port and hopefully make it back to Camelot before you die.

Goblin Leader Island
Goblins are just as tough as dragons therefore you will need the same levels of armour, weapons and fighting skill needed for dragons.  The one big difference is Goblin Leaders will not follow you into the water. The portal to Goblin Island will land you at the return portal on a very small island a short swim  from Goblin leader Island.
